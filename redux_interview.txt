Redux terminologies:
-------------------

1. Store - It holds the whole state tree of our application.

2. provider - The <provider> component makes Redux store available to any nested components

3. Reducer - Reducers are functions that take the current state and an action as arguments, and return a new state result.
             It holds the logic and calculation that needed to be performed on the state.

4. Action - Actions are plain JS object that contains information.

5. useDispatch - This hook returns a reference to the dispatch function from the Redux store.

6. useSelector - It is used to get the state objects. It is a fucntion that takes the current state as an argument
                 and returns whatever data you want from it.

7. Thunk - It allows us to dispatch actions manually.


Context API:
------------

Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass
props down manually at every level.
